Over this lesson you’ve learned:

.upper(), .title(), and .lower() adjust the casing of your string.
.split() takes a string and creates a list of substrings.
.join() takes a list of strings and creates a string.
.strip() cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.
.replace() replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.
.find() searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.
.format() and f-strings allow you to interpolate a string with variables.
Well I’ve been stringing you along for long enough, let’s get some more practice in!
